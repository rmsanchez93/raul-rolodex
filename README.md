# Raul's Rolodex

Solo lab created for the purpose of practicing fetch. JSON data will include past alumni and instructors in an effort to showcase the underrepresented in tech. 
This Lab is going to be a stretch, try timing yourself and see if you can finish this in an hour and a half for added difficulty.  

## Create Your Server

All of the people data is stored in the `db.json` file. You'll want to access this
data using a JSON server. In order to do this, run the following two commands:

   * `npm install -g json-server`
   * `json-server --watch db.json`
   
This will create a server storing all of our people data with restful routes
at `http://localhost:3000/people`. You can also check out
`http://localhost:3000/people/:id`

## Look At What We Have To Start With 

This index.html is heavily relying on bootstrap styling, get comfortable at going through the index.html page. 
Sometimes it can help to 'collaspe' larger divs to find a particular div. 
**you should NOT have to change anything in the index.html**

We have a static card already in our index.html, this is so you have a frame of reference, feel free to comment it out and dynamically add the other people from our fetch that way Raúl is not on there twice(the world is not ready for two Raúls)

          Please take a look at the data you would get back from every person object. There are a couple of boolean variables that are NOT accesible through dot notation. Again, this lab might feel like a big stretch, follow Personal Empowerment Protocol. Another hint is at the bottom of this README
          
## Fetch and Update DOM with People 

On the `index.html` page, there is a `div` with the `id` "people".

When the page loads, make a 'GET' request to fetch all the person objects. With the
response data, make a `<div class="card p-2 m-2" style="width: 18rem;">` for each person and add it to the
people `div`.

## Add Person Info to the Card

Each card should have the following child elements:

  * `img` tag with the `src` of the person's image attribute and the class name "card-img-top" (bonus: there's an alt property we can change for accessibility, try updating with the person's name followed by their role(either instructor or alum) i.e. 'Joe, instructor', or 'Lili, alum')
  * `div` tag with a class "card-body"
  
  
The `div` with class "card-body" has child elements: 
  * `h5` tag with a class "card-title" whose text is set to the person's name property
  *  `p` tag that conditionally renders Either Instructor or Not Instructor based on a person's 'instructor?' property
  *  `p` tag that conditionally renders Either Alum or Not Alum based on a person's 'alum?' property
  *  `p` tag that displays the person's pronouns 
  *  `p` tag that conditionally renders whether or not this person attended Flatiron School. 
  *  `a` with an href set to the person's github, and a class "btn btn-primary" whose text is set to "Go to <person's first name> 's GitHub"
  
          How we get a person's first name from their name? 
          What does conditionally rendering mean?? (I'll post a link at the end of this readme)
          Hint => look up ternary operators, but feel free to ask for help if this becomes confusing
          
  **All `p` tags have a class "card-text"**
  

After all of that, the person card should resemble:

```html
  <div class="card p-2 m-2" style="width: 18rem;">
            <img src=person_image_url class="card-img-top" alt=person_first_name_and_either_alum_instructor>
            <div class="card-body">
              <h5 class="card-title"> person_name </h5>
              <p class="card-text"> person_insturctor_alum </p>
              <p class="card-text">Prefered Pronouns: person_pronouns </p>
              <p class="card-text">Attended Flatiron?  person_attended_flatiron </p>
              <a href= person_github_url class="btn btn-primary"> Go to person_first_name's GitHub </a>
            </div>
  </div>
```


## Add yourself with our Instructors/Alum

* When a user submits the form, a `POST` request is sent to `http://localhost:3000/people` and the new person is added to our people collection.
* In order to send a POST request via Fetch, give the Fetch a second argument of an object. This object should specify the method as `POST` and also provide the appropriate headers and the JSON-ified data for the request. I removed how a POST Request object should look like, please refer to your notes or previous lab-work.

* For examples, refer to the [documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch#Supplying_request_options).


## Stretch Goals

* Add an update button for every card
* the button should make an edit form appear under the person's info, with one input to only update that person's name
*changes should update the DOM and be persisted.

## Hints Below
          Hint => look up ternary operators, but feel free to ask for help if this becomes confusing. 
          Hint => look up bracket notation for objects in javascript
          Hint => div elements can be treated like object to access or even set properties
